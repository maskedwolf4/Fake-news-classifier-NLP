# Fake-news-classifier-NLP
Welcome to the Fake News Classifier NLP project! This project is designed to identify and classify news articles as either real or fake by leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques. By analyzing the linguistic patterns and content of news articles, the model can make informed predictions about the authenticity of the information.
